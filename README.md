Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Ryan, and I am a full-stack developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. Let me give you a brief overview of what I'm currently working on.

### Projects
#### Easy-Email
I am actively maintaining the Easy-Email project. Easy-Email is a powerful email library that simplifies the process of editing email templates. If you're looking for an easy-to-use and reliable solution for your email needs, I highly recommend checking it out.

#### Commercial Email Project
In addition to Easy-Email, I am also involved in developing a commercial version of the email project. This enhanced version comes packed with even more powerful features to cater to advanced email requirements. 
- Responsive Design: Supports displaying different user interfaces for desktop and mobile devices.
- Enhanced Editor: The editor has been improved to use an iframe and is compatible with various browsers.
- Easy Customization: Provides easier customization options to tailor the user interface according to specific needs.

If you're interested in leveraging the full potential of email capabilities for your business, don't hesitate to get in touch with me at ch.mao@qq.com.
