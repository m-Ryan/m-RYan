Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Ryan, and I am a full-stack developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. Let me give you a brief overview of what I'm currently working on.

### Projects
#### Easy-Email
I am actively maintaining the Easy-Email project. Easy-Email is a powerful email library that simplifies the process of editing email templates. If you're looking for an easy-to-use and reliable solution for your email needs, I highly recommend checking it out.

#### Commercial Email Project (500$ per year)
In addition to Easy-Email, I am also involved in developing a commercial version of the email project. This enhanced version comes packed with even more powerful features to cater to advanced email requirements. 
- Responsive Design: Supports displaying different user interfaces for desktop and mobile devices.
- Email Studio: Creating custom blocks and configuration panels through drag-and-drop editing, without the need for coding.
- Enhanced Editor: The editor has been improved to use an iframe and is compatible with various browsers.
- Easy Customization: Provides easier customization options to tailor the user interface according to specific needs.
& We will provide consulting services and email support.

If you're interested in leveraging the full potential of email capabilities for your business, don't hesitate to get in touch with me at ch.mao@qq.com.

Due to too many inquiries, we currently only offer support for issues related to the commercial version of the email editor. For other questions, please leave a comment on GitHub Issues. Thanks.
